Meanwhile, a drifter and artist named Jack Dawson and his best friend Fabrizio De Rossi win third-class tickets to the ship in a game. And she explains the whole story from departure until the death of Titanic on its first and last voyage April 15th, 1912 at 2:20 in the morning."

DiCaprio has gone from relatively humble beginnings, as a supporting cast member of the sitcom Growing Pains (1985) and low budget horror movies, such as Critters 3 (1991), to a major teenage heartthrob in the 1990s, as the hunky lead actor in movies such as Romeo + Juliet (1996) and Titanic (1997), to then become a leading man in Hollywood blockbusters, made by internationally renowned directors such as Martin Scorsese and Christopher Nolan."

Featuring heroic protagonists facing off against formidable foes, these films deliver non-stop excitement with explosive action sequences, daring escapes, and cutting-edge visual effects. From the iconic James Bond series to the epic battles of The Avengers, action movies offer an exhilarating cinematic experience that keeps audiences on the edge of their seats."
